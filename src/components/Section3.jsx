            In Saudi Arabia, rare diseases remain a largely unfamiliar concept.
            Many of the population have never heard of them, let alone
            understand the implications. <br />
            The country is not well-equipped to diagnose and treat these
            diseases, leaving many people in the dark about their health. <br />{" "}
            <br />
            The lack of resources and awareness makes it difficult for those
            suffering from rare diseases to find proper care and support.

        The medical community in Saudi Arabia is still in the early stages of
        understanding rare diseases. There are no reliable statistics on the
        prevalence of these conditions. <br />
        The lack of knowledge and resources makes it difficult to diagnose and
        treat patients, leaving many of them with no answers. <br /> <br />
        The government is beginning to take steps to improve the situation, but
        much remains to be done. <br />
        Despite the challenges, there is hope that the situation will improve.
        The government has begun to invest in research and awareness campaigns
        to raise awareness of rare diseases.
